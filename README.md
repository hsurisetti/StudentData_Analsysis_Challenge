# Student Data Analysis Challenge 
 Analyse the student data to inform Maria on the school budget and their priorities

## Project Overview 
 We are required to perform the below analysis to get the school budget of different school types including the number of students for each school and their average math score .
  ### Analysis invloves
   - Collecting the student data into a new DataFrame
   - Cleaning and preparing the DataFrame for further processing
   - Summarizing the essential data
   - Indepth analysis and extracting the subsets information for analyzing data on them
   - Group all the relevant data and aggregrate them to the final output to provide to the end user
 
 ## Resources 
 - Data Source : electionnew_full_student_data.csv
 - Software :
    - Python 3.7 , Visual Studio code 1.72.2
    - Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12 , Anaconda Dev environment: TestEnv

 ## Student Data Analysis Results 
 The analysis of the student data show the below

## Student Data Summary

 We were able to analyse all the data needed for Maria to present the information to the school district. Our analysis show that Public schools have more budget than the charter schools. But the highest number of students from each school like Montgomery, Green, Dixon high school come from Charter schools, with highest being 2038 students from Montgomery High school. Also the charter schools perform better in math since our analysis show that the math scores in charter schools are higher than public schools

In conclusion, we are able to present Maria with fair amount of student information based of Public and Charter schools and show who is performing better in each of the categories.
